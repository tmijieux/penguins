Les pingouins ou la vie.

play the "hey that's my fish" game on a 1D, 2D or 3D platform (in a 3D view) versus AI or other players    
(it can also be ran with n dimension , n > 3, but without a 3D view)

you can also:
 - program your own AI to play on the platform
 - program a module that generates new map type 

currently available map types are:
  - square
  - hexagonal 
  - triangle
  - octagonal+little square
  - penrose
